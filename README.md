# Tachyon ☄️

> `Note:` There are a lot of comments since this is the first time I programme programming a toy language and it is part of my learning process so that I can make a better language next time.

This is a performance focused language which tries to be an all in one with multiple ways to do everything like defining a function could be done using syntax of many different languages but has a distinct and explicit syntax for itself.
